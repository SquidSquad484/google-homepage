**Description:**
Creating a replication of the Google Homepage. Practices Basic HTML and CSS and becomes familiar with using Developer Tools.

**Reflection:**
I didn't start off well, sort of making my plan along the way and styling with CSS right after creating elements in HTML. This caused me to have a bunch of issues later on: my layout was disorganized, many changes to the HTML were needed and therefore a lot of the CSS was as well, and I had to use "hacky" solutions to fix my code.Even in the beginning I had considered starting over, but for some reason decided not to.
However, after a comment on Discord and watching some videos the user had recommended to me (about basic HTML and CSS) I decided to create a separate HTML and CSS file, kind of "starting over", although I often referenced and copied from my original files. My new google homepage had a better layout, my code was cleaner and more efficient, and it was a lot easier for me to fix my mistakes.

This was very fun(especially at the end lol) but also quite frustrating at times!

**I feel a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS, although I know I still have a lot to learn!** 

One main thing I got away from this project was to **complete the main parts of your HTML *BEFORE* starting on your CSS.** (This was also mentioned to me by another TOP user.) If you don't do this and you need to make some changes to your HTML, you will also need to change your CSS.

If you got here, then happy coding to you!
